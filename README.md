### Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting is a branch of statistical analysis that involves predicting future values of a variable based on its historical behavior over time. It involves the use of various mathematical and statistical models to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in a dataset, which can then be extrapolated into the future to make predictions. Time series forecasting is commonly used in a wide range of applications, such as finance, economics, meteorology, and engineering, to forecast future demand, sales, prices, production, and other variables. Accurate forecasting of time series data is crucial for making informed decisions and planning for the future in many domains.
